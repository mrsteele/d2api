## v1 API

### About

This API is a raw rip from the Diablo 2 data files. It is using all data as it exists today and as it was written for classic Diablo 2.

This is what was used to build the [v2](/v2) API which is cleaned up and supports the graphql requests.
    
These are raw from the tables provided by Blizzard.
