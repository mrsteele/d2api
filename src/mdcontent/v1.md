# D2(R) API - Version 1 (v1)

## About

This API is a raw rip from the Diablo 2 data files. It is using all data as it exists today and as it was written for classic Diablo 2. This is what was used to build the [v2](/v2) API which is cleaned up and supports the graphql requests. I also added a [GraphQL](/api/v1/graphql) service that is extremely simplified and non-relational.
    
These are raw from the tables provided by Blizzard.
